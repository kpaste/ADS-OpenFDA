# ADS-OpenFDA

PG Public Services (PGPS) is proposing a customized Agile-based approach to create an improved version of OpenFDA. Our approach ensures high quality software development with an adaptive architecture, and efficient and effective use of taxpayer funds.  Traditional Agile is a developer-driven methodology focuses on generating code for discrete modules, but this can result in products that are difficult to use, build, and operate. Our user-centered Agile approach builds a common vision through design that harmonizes technical feasibility with business viability by placing the user at the center. The approach has four phases – Discover, Design, Develop & Test, and Deploy & Operate.  Our approach consistently translates our client’s needs into better designs and quicker projects.
PGPS conducts a series of analyses to understand the current state and desired goals. Our user-experience (UX) Inspection identifies potential UX issues. Interviews identify current processes, actors, pain points, and design preferences. PGPS analyzes this data to provide the basis for a user-centered design. PGPS performs a contextual analysis to analyze the as-is functionality and workflow needed. Finally, PGPS creates a conceptual design for the solution that includes a high-level creative concept and business design to frame a solution.
PGPS conducts a series of sprints to build prototypes using wireframes. We utilize wireframes to elicit details and create user stories, acceptance criteria, and technical chores and record them into our proprietary tool, PGA, for managing the Product Backlog. PGA allows our clients to view, group, and prioritize stories into candidates for a sprint. 
From the candidate users stories and chores in PGA, we work with our developers to create a level of effort estimation in ‘story points’ and organize the stories into a sprint plan. Finally, we create the detailed blueprints for the sprint using an approved set of user stories defined that incorporates the functional and technical design.
PGPS approaches development as a series of iterative sprints incorporating test-driven development (TDD) to complement the Agile Scrum framework. We utilize daily scrums to manage development and the acceptance criteria to test and accept the software. Our user-acceptance testing (UAT) evaluates the delivered functionality against the design goals.
The Product Backlog is updated when stories or chores are complete and augmented if additional story or chore details are identified during the sprint. 
At the end of each sprint, we conduct a ‘sprint retrospective’ where we evaluate the design and development process.
PGPS brings into production the tested code in a series of releases. We develop user communication and training and analyze system performance and highlight areas for system improvement. We analyze all monitoring processes for possible break-fix stories that are returned to Design for evaluation.
