We selected Mike Gertz as our Lead/Product Manager to guide the team, make key decisions, and hold the team accountable for a high quality product.  

Mike assembled a multidisciplinary team to of experienced individuals that worked together to deliver our product. Our team was comprised of Jeff Young as the Interaction Designer, Cindy Vazquez as the Designer, and Brad Atefi as the Front-End Web Developer. 

Our team reviewed the RFQ and decided on a tailored version of our four phase approach – Discover, Design, Develop, and Deploy & Operate - to ensure high quality software development with an adaptive architecture, and efficient and effective use of taxpayer funds. Our approach followed an Agile philosophy by building a common vision through design that harmonizes technical feasibility with business viability by placing the user at the center. This allowed us to consistently translate our client’s needs into better designs and quicker projects. Our activities also aligned with the US Digital Services Playbook (DSP). 

We first conducted a UX Inspection that included a series of analyses to understand the current state and users’ desired goals. We interviewed a group of users and identified the current processes, actors, pain points, and design preferences. We studied the current site, documented the as-is functionality, and described to-be functions and workflow. Then, working collectively with the users we created a conceptual design for the solution that included a high-level creative concept and business design to frame a solution. As stated by the DSP, our UX Inspection work focused on understanding what people needed, our Conceptual Design simplified and made things intuitive, and we addressed the whole experience of Open FDA from start to finish. 

We pursued three parallel tracks to complete user-centered design tasks that would produce the outputs we needed for the redesign. The first track was to complete User Stories that served as the main underpinning of this (and any) Agile project. Our users were responsible for developing stories and worked with our Product Manager to create and document them into our PGAgile tool (http://pastegroup.com/pga/ads/). The second track was the development of an Information Architecture, Conceptual Design, and wireframes for the redesigned prototype by our Interaction Designer. The final task was the development of a Visual Design that blended outputs from the UX inspection and the Conceptual Design into visual design comps for the homepage and several subpages. 

The team held daily scrum meeting to manage the development and resolve open issues and questions. The Product Manager updated the product backlog when stories or chores were completed and augmented it when additional stories or chore were needed. 
Our Front-End Web Developer created the first version of the prototype in day-long sprints, following the user stories contained in the PGAgile tool. He reviewed the wireframes and consulted “Frankie” our in-house pattern library to grab reusable front-end code for the prototype. The first sprint focused on the creation of the homepage and the main navigation bar using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and JQuery; these tools are part of the DSP modern tool stack. He tested and revised his code to ensure it was responsive. 

The first checkpoint with the Product Manager and the users took place after the homepage and main navigation were first implemented. Feedback from the team resulted in several positive design changes to the homepage and navigation. A question arose as to the design of the Drugs subpage, so our Product Manager set up a usability test with a couple of users to test which design concept was best. The test told the team which way to go so that the next checkpoint included a revised subpage for Drugs with new visual design elements added to the homepage. In the final checkpoint, users gave their input for remaining pieces of the site, including subpages for Reference and About, and the remainder of the visual design was added. 

We held a user-acceptance meeting with the users and the Product Manager to evaluate the delivery against the design goals.  
As we have demonstrated here, our entire approach engaged users throughout the development process and this aligns to the DSP.
