At the outset of OpenFDA, we selected our Lead/Product Manager for the effort to guide the team, make key decisions, and hold accountable for a high quality product.  He then assembled a multidisciplinary team to of experienced individual that worked together to deliver the product.  
Our team then embarked on our four phase approach – Discover, Design, Develop, and Deploy & Operate and tailored it given the situation. PGPS’ approach ensures high quality software development with an adaptive architecture, and efficient and effective use of taxpayer funds. Our user-centered Agile approach builds a common vision through design that harmonizes technical feasibility with business viability by placing the user at the center. Our approach consistently translates our client’s needs into better designs and quicker projects.
We first conducted a UX Inspection that includes a series of analyses to understand the current state and users desired goals. We interviewed users to identify current processes, actors, pain points, and design preferences. We studied the current site and documented the as-is functionality and the to-be functions and workflow.  Then, working collectively with the users we created a conceptual design for the solution that included a high-level creative concept and business design to frame a solution.
The team then broke into three working groups to focus on user-centered design tass that would produce outputs need for the redesign.  One critical tasking are User Stories that serve as the main underpinning of any Agile project. The users are responsible for developing stories and they worked with our Product Manager to create them and put them into our PGAgile tool (http://pastegroup.com/pga/ads/).  Another tasking is Information Architecture in which our Interaction Designer developed an information architecture of the current site and used the Conceptual Design to develop wireframes for redesigned prototype.  The other key tasking is Visual Design in which our visual designer took the outputs from the UX inspection and the Conceptual Design to develop a Visual Design that included design comps for the homepage and several subpages.  
The team held daily scrums meeting to manage the development to resolve open issues and questions.  The Product Manager updated the product backlog when stories or chores were completed and augmented if additional stories or chore details were identified during the sprint. 
Our Front End developer then embarked on creating the first version of the prototype.  He first consulted the PGAgile tool to focus his efforts for the sprint.  He reviewed the wireframes and consulted “Frankie” our in-house pattern library to grab reusable front-end code for the prototype.  He then embarked on creating the homepage and the main navigation using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and JQuery.  He tested and revised his code to ensure it was responsive.  
The first checkpoint with the Product Manager and the users took place after the homepage and main navigation were first implemented.  Feedback from them resulted in good design changes to the homepage and navigation.  A question arose to the design of the Drugs subpage, so our Product Manager setup a usability test with a couple of users to test which design concept was best.  The test told the team which way to go so that the next checkpoint included a subpage for Drugs and new visual design elements added to the homepage.  In the final checkpoint, users gave their input for remaining pieces of the site, including subpages for Reference and About the rest of the visual design was added.  Finally, we held a user-acceptance meeting with the users and the Product Manager to evaluate the delivery against the design goals.  At the end of the sprint, we conduct a ‘sprint retrospective’ where we evaluate the design and development process.
