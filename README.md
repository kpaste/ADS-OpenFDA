# ADS-OpenFDA

At the outset of OpenFDA, we selected our Lead/Product Manager for the effort to guide the team, make key decisions, and hold accountable for a high quality product.  He then assembled a multidisciplinary team to of experienced individual that worked together to deliver the product.  Our team then embarked on our four phase approach – Discover, Design, Develop, and Deploy & Operate and tailored it given the situation.  

PGPS’ approach ensures high quality software development with an adaptive architecture, and efficient and effective use of taxpayer funds. Our user-centered Agile approach builds a common vision through design that harmonizes technical feasibility with business viability by placing the user at the center. Our approach consistently translates our client’s needs into better designs and quicker projects.

We conducted a UX Inspection that includes a series of analyses to understand the current state and desired goals. We interviewed stakeholders to identify current processes, actors, pain points, and design preferences. By analyzing OpenFDA we documented the as-is functionality and discussed with users the workflow that was needed.  Working collectively with the users, we created a conceptual design for the solution that included a high-level creative concept and business design to frame a solution.

The team then broke into three working groups – User Stories, Information Architecture, and Visual Design, in order to produce the next set of working documents.  The Product Manager and the users collaborated on developing user stories for Open FDA and entered them into our PGAgile tool (http://pastegroup.com/pga/ads/)
